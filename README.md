# Black-Hole-Singularity-
Black Hole Singularity Visualization in Processing

Overview
This project is a 3D visualization of a black hole singularity using the Processing programming environment. It demonstrates the use of various visual elements, such as points and lines, as well as animation techniques, including color gradients, and interactivity through keyboard controls.

Features
3D visualization of points and lines surrounding a black hole singularity
Sinusoidal animation of points with adjustable radius
Adjustable colors and gradients
Interactivity through keyboard controls:
Press 'c' to cycle through different color modes (single color, random colors, smooth color transitions)
Press 's' to save a screenshot with a custom save path
PeasyCam library for 3D camera control and zooming

Dependencies
Processing 3
PeasyCam Library

Installation
Download and install Processing 3 from the official website.
Install the PeasyCam library by opening Processing, then go to Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library. Search for "PeasyCam" and install it.
Clone or download this repository and open the main .pde file with Processing.
Run the sketch.

Usage
Use the mouse to navigate the 3D view (left-click to rotate, scroll wheel to zoom, right-click to pan).
Press the keys mentioned in the "Features" section to interact with the visualization.
